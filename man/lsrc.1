.Xr rcrc 5 ,
under the documentation about
.Va COPY_ALWAYS .
.

for more details. This option can be repeated.

.El
.Sh EXCLUDE PATTERN
The exclude pattern specifies a colon-separated pair of dotfiles
directory and file glob. The dotfiles directory is optional and, if
omitted, defaults to
.Li * ,
which is a special token that matches any dotfiles directory. The file
glob is relative to the dotfiles directory, ignoring meta directories. A
colon combines them.
.
.Pp
For example, to ignore all emacs-related items from the
.Pa thoughtbot-dotfiles
directory, use the exclude pattern:
.Pp
.Dl thoughtbot-dotfiles:*emacs*
.Pp
To ignore any
.Pa bash_profile
file, use the pattern:
.Pp
.Dl *:bash_profile
.Pp
Or more simply:
.Pp
.Dl bash_profile
.Pp
