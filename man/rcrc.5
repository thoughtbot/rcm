.Sh DESCRIPTION
The rcm dotfile manager can be configured using a
.Pa .rcrc
file in your home directory. This location can be changed by setting the
.Pa RCRC
environment variable. The format is POSIX shell. It is sourced in by the
.Xr lsrc 1 ,
.Xr mkrc 1 ,
.Xr rcdn 1 ,
and
.Xr rcup 1
programs.
.Pp
It supports these variables:
.Bl -tag -width "DOTFILES_DIRS"
.It Va COPY_ALWAYS
always copy files that match the listed globs, never symlink them.
.
.It Va DOTFILES_DIRS
the source directories for dotfiles. The first in the list is the
source to which dotfiles created using
.Xr mkrc 1
are installed. The default value is
.Pa ~/.dotfiles
.
.It Va EXCLUDES
a space-separated list of exclude patterns. Exclude patterns are
explained in detail in
.Xr lsrc 1
under the section
.Sx EXCLUDE PATTERN .
.
.It Va HOSTNAME
the hostname for this computer. This is normally computed using the
.Xr hostname 1
command, but this command is non-standard and can prove unreliable. The
.Va HOSTNAME
variable forces a known hostname.
.It Va TAGS
the default tags.
.It Va TARGET
the new default location to manage dotfiles relative to.
.
.It Va SYMLINK_DIRS
a space-separated list of patterns. Directories matching a pattern are
symlinked instead of descended. Patterns are explained in detail in
.Xr lsrc 1
under the section
.Sx EXCLUDE PATTERN .
.
.It Va UNDOTTED
a space separated list of patterns. Files matching this pattern
will be symlinked without a leading dot. If a file is also in
.Va SYMLINK_DIRS ,
then the directory will be symlinked without a leading dot.
Patterns are explained in detail in
.Xr lsrc 1
under the section
.Sx EXCLUDE PATTERN .

exercise around patterns, see the BUGS section of
